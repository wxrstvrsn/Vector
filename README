# How to run tests

If you are a MIREA student and
you have access to the cathedral
server, then log in, upload the
following files to one folder

Compile an object file "Stack.o" from your "Vector.cpp" :
- g++ -c Vector.cpp -o Vector.o


Then we check that the test and the object are in the
same directory, and from it we make
- g++ Vector.o -o test -L./ -lTest.a

Then ./test
